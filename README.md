This repository documents my journey of learning Machine Learning Operations (MLOps). The goal is to build hands-on experience with the end-to-end ML lifecycle

MLOps — My Journey into Machine Learning Operations

This repository documents my hands-on learning path in MLOps — the bridge between machine learning and reliable, scalable production systems.
It’s a living repo where I explore and implement end-to-end MLOps concepts using tools like DVC, MLflow, Docker, CI/CD, and Kubernetes.

## Project Vision

Machine Learning models are only as useful as their ability to be deployed, monitored, and improved continuously.
This repository focuses on turning ML prototypes into production-grade systems by learning and applying MLOps best practices step-by-step.

I’ll be covering:

 Experiment Tracking — logging metrics, parameters, and artifacts with MLflow

 Data Versioning — using DVC to manage datasets and pipelines

 Containerization — packaging models with Docker for portability

 CI/CD Pipelines — automating testing, training, and deployment

 Deployment & Scaling — using Kubernetes for orchestration
